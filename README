A collection of some definitions to make writing Hadoop jobs in Scala more
enjoyable.  The implicit definitions were inspired by Jonhnny Wessley's
SHadoop project at http://code.google.com/p/jweslley/.  There were some 
unnecessary implicits, however, which have been removed since they applied
to the deprecated mapred Hadoop API or were subsumed by 
collection.JavaConversions.

There are also some common Reducers which show how the Hadoop conversions are
useful.
